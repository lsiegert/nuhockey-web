Web interface to add and edit the games my NUHockey app uses

what I really need is a way to import a whole season of games at once,
preferably before October 2012, because I do not want to have to do
all of them by hand!

it also as of 2012-03-30 looks not so great on a phone, which is where
I use the site most often.
